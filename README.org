* boost-filesystem-test

This is a simple example for my CMake modularization of boost. It uses =boost.filesystem= and all of its dependencies.

* Run

To test the example on a *nix system (like Linux or Mac OSX), open a shell and run the following commands.

#+begin_src sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Elzair/cmake-boost-filesystem-test.git
cd cmake-boost-filesystem-test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./test-filesystem ../test.cpp # This should print "../test.cpp 329"
#+end_src sh
